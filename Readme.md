## How to build an Interactive JIRA Velocity Bar Chart? Atlassian Browser Coding Round Interview Question

In this question, we need to a build an interactive bar chart similar to velocity charts we see in Atlassian's JIRA product.

Functional Requirements
There should be a button that can be used to toggle the visibility of the chart.
Department data would be provided using which we need to draw a Bar chart where Y axis represents the no. of tickets and X axis represents the departments.
Each bar should be scaled based on the highest no. of tickets.
Each bar should have a tooltip that displays department name along with no. of tickets when a bar is hovered.
Bar's height should animate from 0 to final value upon entry and exit.

## Next js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
